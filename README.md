# AutoTF Documentation

## Info

This repo contains the documentation for the AutoTF systems as implemented and is still an active **Work-In-Progress**.

Be aware that the documentation might not reflect the actual code in every corner.

The documentation might lag behind a bit, because the safety and functionality of actively running systems is priorizied.

## Drawn Documentation

Documentation is made using Draw.IO and saved in [DrawIODOC](https://github.com/AutoTF-Rail/AutoTf-Documentation/tree/main/DrawIODOC/)



## 3D models

The molds for motors, and other prototyping is done in blender, and all models can be found in [Models](https://github.com/AutoTF-Rail/AutoTf-Documentation/tree/main/Models/).


There will always be a printable example version in the [ExampleLever](https://github.com/AutoTF-Rail/AutoTf-Documentation/tree/main/Models/Export/Print/ExampleLever/) folder.
